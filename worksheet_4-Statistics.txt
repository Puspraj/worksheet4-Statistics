Subjective Answer

10>Answer:- Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution 
           that is symmetric about the mean,showing that data near the mean are more frequent in 
           occurrence than data far from the mean.

11>Answer:- Handle missing data:
          i>Listwise
         ii>Pairwise deletion
        iii>Mean substitution
         iv>Regression inputation
          v>Last observation crried forward
         vi>Maximum likelihood

       Imputation technique:
      i>Time series problem
     ii>General problem

12>Answer:- A/B testing is a user experience research methodology. . A/B tests consist of a randomized 
            experiment with two variants, A and B. It includes application of statistical hypothesis 
            testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics.

13>Answer:- Bad practice in general
           -If just estimating means: mean imputationpreserves the observed data.
           -Leads to an underestimate of the standard deviation.
           -Distorts relationships between variables by "pulling" estimates of the correlation toward zero.

14>Answer:-In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a
           scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.The case of one explanatory variable is
           called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called
           multiple linear regression.

15>Answer:-The two main branches of statistics are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
           Both of these are employed in scientific analysis of data and both are equally important 
           for the student of statistics.
